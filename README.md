# TEG Coding Challenge

A web application that shows:
- A listing of all events taking place at a user selected venue.
- A user should be able to change the venue and view all events at
this venue.
- When a user clicks on an event, the user should be shown
various information fields about this event, at a minimum the
name of the event, the date/time and location. Some events
contain a description.
- How you display the events is completely up to you. You may
choose to implement a list/table view, a tile/card view, or a rich
calendar view.

This application must be able to run in any modern
web browser such as Edge, Chrome, Safari and Firefox.

A web application listening on https://localhost:9000.
This should be hosted behind an IIS web server.
